Linux Distribution Comparison Project

Kali Linux • Fedora Workstation • Ubuntu Server

This project analyzes and compares three major Linux distributions based on real installations and hands-on configuration. Unlike typical theoretical comparisons, this analysis is based on actual installs of Kali Linux, Fedora Workstation, and Ubuntu Server, performed as part of the Linux Administration course.

The goal of this project is to understand how different Linux ecosystems approach:

Package management

Init systems

Filesystem structure

Installation options

Default shells, desktops, and servers

Administrative workflows

Use-case specializations

🔥 1. Kali Linux (Debian-based)

(Cybersecurity & Pen-testing Focus)

Based on Debian

Package manager: apt + dpkg

Init system: systemd

GUI: Xfce

Shell: Zsh

Ideal for: security testing, forensics, red-team workflows

You observed that Kali provides a polished, security-focused environment with ready-to-use tools.


Liux Distros Comparison (2)

🔥 2. Fedora Workstation (Red Hat-based)

(Developer & Cutting-edge OS)

Based on Red Hat (RPM ecosystem)

Package manager: dnf

Init system: systemd

Desktop: GNOME

Shell: bash

Ideal for: software development, testing modern Linux features

You noted Fedora is stable, modern, and aligned with DevOps/enterprise workflows.


Liux Distros Comparison (2)

🔥 3. Ubuntu Server (Debian-based)

(Cloud, Server & Enterprise Focus)

Based on Debian

Package manager: apt

Init system: systemd

No GUI by default

Optimized for: cloud, containerization, production servers

You highlighted Ubuntu Server’s alignment with real enterprise environments and cloud deployments.
